#Front end issues <br/><br/>
From messing with code and the actual page it self some errors I have found is the simple search doesn't seem to work on the front-end but when tested with postman the back end search is fine.
Another is inputting data for example when trying to edit a question does not seem to work either.
#Will update if I come back to this project and find any more or fix any.
